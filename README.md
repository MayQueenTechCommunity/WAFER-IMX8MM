### MayQueen introduces CITADEL-HMI
Which is an HMI (Human-Machine-Interface) open frame board based on NXP i.MX8M-Mini processor

Designed to bring out the full capabilities of the i.MX8M-Mini SoC, CITADEL-HMI provides 4GB RAM and 32GB eMMC, 1 Gigabit Ethernet, RGMII, 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 UARTs for RS232/RS422/RS485, buzzer, audio headest jack and 2 I2Cs. Display connectivity is supported with up to 1080P resolution eDP panel, we provide different size panels for CITADEL-HMI, Measuring just 155 x 110 x 35 mm size with metal enclosure, CITADEL-HMI also features optional WiFi 802.11ac and Bluetooth 5.x interfaces.

Excellent connectivity, low cost and small size make CITADEL-HMI a modular solution for many applications such as panel PC with open frame, digital signage, robotic controller, and low power efficiency device. In addition, CITADEL-HMI incorporates numerous design innovations on its metal shell, such as easy disassembly and the addition of a dedicated shield for debugging/programming software. This feature allows you to perform development tasks without the need to dismantle the entire casing.

Software Support
CITADEL-HMI is provided with a full BSP and ready-to-run images for the Linux/Android operating system.
The CITADEL-HMI BSP includes Linux kernel up to 5.10, Yocto/Ubuntu/Android BSP and U-Boot boot-loader.
